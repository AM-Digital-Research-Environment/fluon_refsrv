## Getting started

* use [dmkg/fo_training](https://gitlab.uni-bayreuth.de:dmkg/fo_training) to train models for recommendation

## Next Steps

right now, this is a working base version which has room for improvements.

### Obtaining Recommendations for Known Users

Right now, this reports a simple list of items ordered by ranking from the database. maybe this can be adjusted by offering cluster/group assignments of items to the frontend as well

### Obtaining Recommendations for New Users

new users just get to see the list of most average cluster items. can this be done better/different?
